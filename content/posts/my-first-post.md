# My First Hugo Post

Got my first hand on `Hugo`.
Unlike many other web-frameworks, I found `Hugo` to be extremely viable and convenient for beginners to build their own website.

I was able to do the following actions in less than an hour:

1. Installed *extended* version of `Hugo` via `snap`

2. Installed `Hugo-coder` theme via git

3. Manipulated `config.toml` with the default template provided by the theme-maker

4. Added a post using `hugo new posts/my-first-post.md`

5. Manipulated the `markdown` file created by the step above
